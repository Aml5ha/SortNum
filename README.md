I made a differnet script called Destroy that destroys the gameobject on click. I added the scipt to the prefab of the sphere so that each clone of the prefab has the ability to be destroyed on click.- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f77Vhg6PBnE 

Falling spheres - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i30menw6gvU

I started to add touch controls, but ran into a snag with testing. I used Raycasting and 2D physics to detect collisions between the touch input (converted to a vector using raycasting) and the hitbox of the spheres.

Created a method that generates random numbers from 1 to 100.
